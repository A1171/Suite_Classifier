Put path to Google drive project folder in "ProjectFolder" variable in "Haders" section of Colab notebook. ProjectFolder="/content/drive/MyDrive/NN/SuiteClassifier1/". Put list of categories in "Haders" section of Colab notebook. "Captions=["CrashComisar","WaterWell","electric","evacuator","PCHelp","DoorBreak","Doors","GlassRepair"]".   Colab notebook should work.
